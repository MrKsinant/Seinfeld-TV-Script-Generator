# Seinfeld TV Script Generator

This study corresponds to the third project of Nanodegree *Deep Learning* schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to provide a deep learning algorithm that can **generate original and consistent TV scripts** based on the American television sitcom **Seinfeld** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld): To achieve this objective a RNN (recurrent neural network) has been used and trained on the scripts of all of the episodes of the 9 seasons of the sitcom.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:
* The file ***seinfeld_tv_script_generator.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The file *helper.py*, a small library of functions which main purpose is to manage the data and the generated model;
* The file *seinfeld_unittests.py*, a collection of unit tests for a wide array of functions written for the study;
* The file *workspace_utils.py*, which contains specific code to run programs properly inside Udacity working environments;
* The folder *data*, which contains the data and the preprocessed data used to train the neural network;
* The folder *images*, which contains all the images used to illustrate the study;
* The folder *training*, which contains the files generated during the training session of the neural network (due to the weight of the generated model, *trained_rnn.pth*, more than 50 Mo, this file hasn't been provided);
* The folder *tv_scripts*, which contains the TV scripts generated by the model.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the deep learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to **PyTorch** (https://pytorch.org), the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by **Facebook** and its **FAIR** (Facebook AI Research) team (https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/).
